Have you heard people talking about machine learning but only have a fuzzy idea of what that means? Are you tired of nodding your way through conversations with co-workers? Let’s change that!

This guide is for anyone who is curious about machine learning but has no idea where to start. I imagine there are a lot of people who tried reading the wikipedia article, got frustrated and gave up wishing someone would just give them a high-level explanation. That’s what this is.

### [Cheat Sheets for AI, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Big Data](https://becominghuman.ai/cheat-sheets-for-ai-neural-networks-machine-learning-deep-learning-big-data-678c51b4b463)

The Most Complete List of Best AI Cheat Sheets. Over the past few months, I have been collecting AI cheat sheets. From time to time I share them with friends and colleagues and recently I have been getting asked a lot, so I decided to organize and share the entire collection. To make things more interesting and give context, I added descriptions and/or excerpts for each major topic.

### [Machine Learning for Humans](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/why-machine-learning-matters-6164faf1df12)

Simple, plain-English explanations accompanied by math, code, and real-world examples.

[Update 9/2/17] This series is now available as a full-length e-book! [Download here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vvh0lkxcljgzlhy/machine_learning_for_humans.pdf?dl=0).
