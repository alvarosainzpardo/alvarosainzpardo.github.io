* [pmdarima](https://github.com/tgsmith61591/pmdarima): Pyramid brings R's beloved auto.arima to Python, making an even stronger case for why you don't need R for data science. [https://www.alkaline-ml.com/pmdarima](https://www.alkaline-ml.com/pmdarima). Pmdarima (originally pyramid-arima, for the anagram of 'py' + 'arima') is a no-nonsense statistical Python library with a solitary objective: bring R's [auto.arima](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/7.3/topics/auto.arima) functionality to Python. Pmdarima operates by wrapping [statsmodels.tsa.ARIMA](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/master/statsmodels/tsa/arima_model.py) and [statsmodels.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/blob/master/statsmodels/tsa/statespace/sarimax.py) into one estimator class and creating a more user-friendly estimator interface for programmers familiar with scikit-learn.

## Documentaci√≥n, libros

* [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.org/fpp2/): This textbook is intended to provide a comprehensive introduction to forecasting methods and to present enough information about each method for readers to be able to use them sensibly.We use R throughout the book and we intend students to learn how to forecast with R.
